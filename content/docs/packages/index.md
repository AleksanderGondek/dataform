Dataform packages are collections of code that help other analysts work with data. Some packages help model specific datasets (for example the [Segment package](https://docs.dataform.co/packages/dataform-segment)), and other packages make helpful utility functions available for others to use (soon, watch this space).

To see how packages work, you can watch the following video describing the [BigQuery Audit Logs package](packages/dataform-bq-audit-logs)
